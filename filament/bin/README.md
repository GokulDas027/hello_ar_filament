To build this app, you must first download a copy of
[Filament](https://github.com/google/filament/releases) for your operating system.

After downloading the release, extract it and copy the binary called `matc` (Linux and macOS) or
`matc.exe` (Windows) into folder `./filament/bin`. This binary is necessary to compile the shaders
used by this demo.
